 /**
  * NOTE (Johannes)
  *
  * myfonts.com ships their fonts with the following remote import
  * and preceding comment:
  *
  * > @import must be at top of file, otherwise CSS will not work
  * @import url("//hello.myfonts.net/count/3ae7d8");
  *
  * The comment is *not true*.
  * We serve the font locally and the css "will work".
  *
  * We paid for 500k pageviews and myfonts.com would like to count that.
  * We're okay with that, we agreed to the license.
  * What we're not okay with is the technical solution.
  * The import is blocking page loads with an unnecessary HTTP request
  * to a 3rd party endpoint. We will do this asynchronously instead.
