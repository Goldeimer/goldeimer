# Visual Studio Code settings & recommended extensions

Recommended `vscode` settings and extensions.

None of either is a prerequisite for successful development of the project.
Neither is use of the editor itself.
When using `vscode`, some are indisputably helpful to the workflow.
Some of those also are without competition (i.e. an alternative of comparable capability does not exist).
Others are mere recommendations, opinionated to varying degrees.

Settings set under the `settings` key in the workspace file as well as those in `settings.json` apply to the root directory and all its children.
Those set in the latter may be overridden in further `.vscode/settings.json` files further down the directory hierarchy.
